    Instructions: Welcome to the WayForward Unity Programmer Test.  This test
    consists of 3 parts.  
    
    First, Answer the questions in the AnswerMe region

    Second, follow the instructions in the ImplementTheseFunctions
    region below. 
    
    Third, Implement a simple Match 3 using Unity UI (Canvas based UI).
    The Match3 should function in 16:9 portrait mode (so 9:16)
    Match 3 features requires:
        * 5 different tile types - Starting point prefabs provided in Prefab folder, modify as necessary
        * A 9x9 grid that gets randomly populated with the tiles
        * The Ability for the player to touch a tile and swap it with an adjacent tile
        * The Functionality to detect matches
            * 3 or more tiles of the same type adjacent to each other in a line (horizontally or vertically)
            * Matches that overlap (such as a T shape) should count as a single match (of 5 tiles)
        * Giving points based on matches
        * Removing matched tiles
        * Moving tiles down to fill empty spots
        * Randomly spawning tiles at the top row to fill empty spots there
    A very limited start has been provided in the Match3 scene, TODO comments have been left in
    Grid.cs to help you get started.

    Answer the following questions in the space below each.

    1. What is an if statement
    It is a conditional statement that has a boolean expression returning true or false. Used to help branch your code based on the condition.

    1a. How is a while statement different from an if statement?
    A while statement will continue to execute the code inside it until the statement is false. An If statement is a one time check and one time execution.

    1b. How is a while statement different from a for statement?
    A For loop will know how many times to execute the code and a while loop gives you more flexibility when to stop it. 
    The main difference is just orginzation, you could really use both in most situations. For loops are easier to read when you would 
    like an exact number of executions, looping through arrays and dictionaries. While loops are easier to read when using an existing variable in your loop. 

    2. What is the difference between an Array and a Linked List?
    Array elements are associated with an index. Linked Lists nodes contain references to the previous and next element. Linked Lists 
    are more flexible and dynamic and Arrays are easier to extract out an exact element from index. Insertion and deletion in Arrays 
    consume time while Linked Lists can do this very quick. Linked Lists also require more storage use.

    2a. Give an example of when you would use an Array instead of a Linked List.
    Most scenarios an array is more proper. I also want to point out that List in .net C# is incredibly powerful and I would almost always use List of Linked Lists.
    An example I can think of is after you just pulled the data for the high score list, you want to maintain the order and you also have a defined list of information
    that you won't be adding or deleting from. So you probably want to display the high score list to the user and maybe you make each player clickable. The array will
    be much easier to randomly access whichever player the click and the array allows you to easily maintain the proper order.

    2b. Give an example of when you would use a Linked List instead of an Array.
	A linked list should be used when you will be making a lot of additions and deletions and not doing any kind of random access.
	An example I can think of is if you had a game with levels. Maybe these levels have doors on each end and then you can easily pull from the 
	linked list which is the previous or forward level. A player could never reach a random level without going through a door so you always have
	the current node and can access the correct level much faster. This example could also all to easily add levels, especially if the game unlocks
